## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the development of Comet, here's how to setup an development enviroment:

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Building the Project**

   As comet uses [`SQLx`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) under the hood, you'll need to set up the database initially. To do so, you will need to perform an offline compilation. Build the project with the env variable `SQLX_OFFLINE` as `true`:

   ```bash
   SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo build
   ```

2. **Setup Environment Variables**

   After building the project initially, you can create an `.env` file in the root of the project and set `DATABASE_URL` as `sqlite://data.db` for compile-time checks.

If you make changes to any SQL queries, you'll need to regenerate the `/sqlx-data.json` file for any further offline compilation. You can regenerate it with the [SQLx CLI](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/tree/main/sqlx-cli) through `cargo sqlx prepare`.
